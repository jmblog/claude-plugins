# UI Design Guidelines

## Quick start

Analyze existing UI:
```
1. Review against cognitive principles (Mental Model, Signifiers, Mapping)
2. Check simplification opportunities
3. Evaluate visual design (Gestalt, hierarchy)
4. See references/checklist.md for systematic review
```

Design new UI:
```
1. Start with Mental Model analysis
2. Apply simplification principles
3. Design with clear Signifiers and Mapping
4. See references/cognitive-principles.md for patterns
```

## Core Workflow

**Step 1: Understand Context**
- Interface type (web/mobile/desktop)
- User goals and tasks
- Platform constraints

**Step 2: Apply HIG Principles**
- Cognitive principles → See [cognitive-principles.md](references/cognitive-principles.md)
- Simplification → See [simplification.md](references/simplification.md)
- Visual design → See [visual-design.md](references/visual-design.md)
- Information architecture → See [information-architecture.md](references/information-architecture.md)

**Step 3: Generate Recommendations**
- List specific improvements with guideline references
- Prioritize by impact and effort
- Provide code examples where applicable

**Step 4: Validate**
- Check accessibility → See [accessibility-localization.md](references/accessibility-localization.md)
- Verify platform conventions → See [platform-specific.md](references/platform-specific.md)

## Key Guidelines (Overview)

### Cognitive Principles
Mental Model, Signifiers, Mapping, Consistency → [Details](references/cognitive-principles.md)

### Simplification
Simplify, Make it Easy → [Details](references/simplification.md)

### Visual Design
Visual Gestalt, Tone & Manner, Layout → [Details](references/visual-design.md)

### Information Architecture
Wayfinding, Navigation, Object-Based Design → [Details](references/information-architecture.md)

### Interaction Patterns
User Control, Direct Manipulation, Input Forms → [Details](references/interaction-patterns.md)

### Feedback & Responsiveness
Responsive Interaction, Contextual Feedback → [Details](references/feedback-responsiveness.md)

### Platform-Specific
Mobile vs Desktop, Touch interfaces → [Details](references/platform-specific.md)

### Accessibility
Screen readers, color independence → [Details](references/accessibility-localization.md)

## Complete Guidelines Index

See [references/guidelines-overview.md](references/guidelines-overview.md) for all 100 guidelines.

## Implementation Support

For code examples: See [references/implementation-patterns.md](references/implementation-patterns.md)

Includes React, Vue, and vanilla JavaScript patterns.

## Relationship with improving-ux

**designing-ui**: Structural patterns (Mental Model, Signifiers, Mapping, navigation, layout)

**improving-ux**: Psychological patterns (Social Proof, Scarcity, Loss Aversion, persuasion)

Use both for comprehensive UX design.
