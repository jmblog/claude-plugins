# UX Growth

## Core Analysis Workflow

When analyzing or improving a user experience:

1. **Understand the Context**
   - Identify the target page, feature, or flow to analyze
   - Understand business goals (conversion, engagement, retention, etc.)
   - Determine the target audience and their mental models

2. **Conduct Psychological Analysis**
   - Review the current design against UX psychology principles
   - Identify cognitive biases being leveraged (or missed opportunities)
   - Evaluate cognitive load and information architecture
   - Assess visual hierarchy and attention flow

3. **Generate Prioritized Recommendations**
   - List specific, actionable improvements based on psychological principles
   - Prioritize by impact potential and implementation effort
   - Reference specific psychological effects being applied
   - Provide before/after examples or concrete implementation guidance

4. **Validate with Principles**
   - Cross-check recommendations against the full principles reference
   - Ensure recommendations don't conflict or create new issues
   - Consider accessibility and ethical implications

## Quick Reference: Key UX Psychology Principles

This section provides a condensed overview. For detailed explanations, examples, and implementation guidance, read `references/principles.md`.

### Cognitive & Perceptual Effects

- **Aesthetic-Usability Effect**: Beautiful designs are perceived as more usable
- **Cognitive Load**: Minimize mental effort required to process information
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Guide attention through size, color, contrast, and positioning
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Reveal information gradually to prevent overwhelm
- **Miller's Law**: People can hold 7±2 items in working memory

### Behavioral & Decision-Making

- **Anchoring Effect**: First information encountered shapes subsequent judgments
- **Loss Aversion**: People prefer avoiding losses over acquiring equivalent gains
- **Confirmation Bias**: Users seek information confirming existing beliefs
- **Choice Paradox**: Too many options can decrease decision-making and satisfaction
- **Default Effect**: Pre-selected options have disproportionate acceptance rates

### Social & Trust

- **Social Proof**: People follow others' actions, especially under uncertainty
- **Authority Bias**: Users trust information from perceived experts or authorities
- **Reciprocity**: People feel obligated to return favors or gestures
- **Familiarity Principle**: Users prefer interfaces similar to what they know

### Motivation & Engagement

- **Goal Gradient Effect**: Users accelerate effort as they approach goals
- **Variable Reward**: Unpredictable rewards maintain interest and engagement
- **Gamification**: Game-like elements increase motivation and participation
- **Endowment Effect**: People value things more once they feel ownership

### Persuasion Techniques

- **Scarcity Effect**: Limited availability increases perceived value
- **Urgency**: Time constraints motivate faster decision-making
- **Foot in the Door**: Small initial commitments lead to larger ones
- **Priming**: Initial stimuli influence subsequent behavior and perception
- **Framing Effect**: Presentation format affects decision-making

## Common Use Cases

### Conversion Optimization

For landing pages, signup flows, or checkout processes:
- Apply **Social Proof** (testimonials, user counts, trust badges)
- Use **Scarcity** and **Urgency** for time-sensitive offers
- Reduce **Cognitive Load** by simplifying forms and steps
- Leverage **Loss Aversion** in copy ("Don't miss out" vs "Get this benefit")
- Apply **Anchoring Effect** in pricing displays

### Engagement & Retention

For dashboards, apps, or content platforms:
- Use **Goal Gradient Effect** with progress indicators
- Apply **Variable Reward** for content discovery or notifications
- Implement **Gamification** with points, badges, or streaks
- Leverage **Endowment Effect** through personalization
- Use **Progressive Disclosure** to prevent overwhelm

### Onboarding & Adoption

For first-time user experiences:
- Apply **Foot in the Door** with small initial commitments
- Use **Familiarity Principle** by matching known patterns
- Reduce **Cognitive Load** with guided tours
- Leverage **Goal Gradient Effect** with setup checklists
- Apply **Social Proof** showing how others use the product

### Information Architecture

For content organization and navigation:
- Apply **Miller's Law** to menu and category limits
- Use **Visual Hierarchy** to guide attention
- Implement **Progressive Disclosure** for complex information
- Leverage **Confirmation Bias** by providing multiple paths to the same goal
- Apply **Choice Paradox** considerations in menu design

## Ethical Considerations

When applying psychological principles:

- **Respect User Autonomy**: Don't manipulate users into unwanted actions
- **Transparency**: Be honest about scarcity, urgency, and social proof claims
- **Accessibility**: Ensure psychological enhancements don't exclude users
- **Dark Patterns**: Avoid deceptive practices that harm user trust
- **Privacy**: Don't use psychological techniques to extract unwanted data

Prioritize long-term user satisfaction and trust over short-term conversion gains.
